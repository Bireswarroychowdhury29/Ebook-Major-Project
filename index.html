      <small>"Now this looks like a very interesting case," Detective Peterson said aloud, as she reviewed the huge stack of reports on her desk. "I think I will handle this one myself."</small>

      <small>After several minutes of searching through the official Tooth Fairy records, she found what she was looking for. A folder with the name ‘Sophia Sue Simmons’.</small>

      <small>As Detective Peterson read the report, she noted that Sophia Sue always smiled. From the time she got out of bed to the time she went back to bed, she smiled. In fact, Sophia Sue never seemed to stop smiling.</small>
